# SCA3S: Side-Channel Analysis as a Service

<!--- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

*Acting as a component part of the
[SCARV](https://www.scarv.org)
project,
SCA3S is a collection of resources that support the development 
and analysis of cryptographic implementations wrt.
[side-channel attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack):
it places particular emphasis on analogue side-channels (e.g.,
power and EM) stemming from
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org)-based
platforms.*

<!--- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

## Overview

Forming a sub-field of more general implementation attacks, a
[side-channel attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack)
on some cryptographic target demands (at least) two phases:
a) acquisition of a data set,
   then
b) (crypt)analysis of said data set, which aims to satisfy a
   goal such as key recovery.
Particularly where the side-channel in question is
*analogue* (e.g., power consumption)
vs.
 *digital* (e.g., execution time)
in nature, the acquisition phase can present some significant
practical challenges.  Examples include
capital investment wrt. equipment, maintenance and operational experience, and logistics;
even though low-cost platforms such as
[ChipWhisperer](https://newae.com/tools/chipwhisperer)
help to some extent, the concept of
[Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership)
means they can still impact on how applicable the approach is.

The SCA3S project is intended as a suite of tools that, in c
ombination, help to address such challenges.  The concept is 
simple: it aims to deliver a form of
"side-channel analysis [as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service)",
in a sense virtualising the resources and processes required
by locating them in the cloud and offering remote access via
high-level APIs.  As a result, it has applications in a wide
range of potential use-cases: examples include

- a side-channel oriented form of
  [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration),
  potentially allowing small development teams to improve the
  resilience of their cryptographic implementations,
- shared use of bespoke or niche equipment, e.g., where some
  cryptographic design or standardisation process requires a
  forms of
  [build-it, break-it, fix-it](https://builditbreakit.org) 
  approach,
- forms of
  [CTF-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)
  contest,
- as a means of supporting scientific tenets such as
  [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
  and
  [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)
  wrt. research publications.

## Organisation

Originally this repository housed *all* resources in one place,
but to make them easier to manage, it *now* acts as a container: 
the resources are housed in dedicated submodules.  Specifically, 
these include

- [`scarv/sca3s-spec`](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s-spec)
  houses the
  specification and documentation: we use this approach because 
  it
  a) offers an overarching perspective of,
     and
  b) deals more neatly with interaction between
  the individual resources (vs. embedding it in said resources).
- [`scarv/sca3s-target`](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s-target)
  houses a
  framework for developing target implementations.  The idea is
  that users will fork the repository, which then supports a
  a) uniform communication interface to,
     and
  b) build system for
  the target implementation then developed within it.
- [`scarv/sca3s-acquire`](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s-acquire)
  houses the
  software portion of the acquisition appliance; in combination
  with appropriate hardware, it allows generation data sets
  (e.g., power consumption traces)
  stemming from execution of a given target implementation.
- [`scarv/sca3s-cloud`](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s-cloud)
  houses the
  cloud, or, more specifically
  [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)-based,
  infrastructure which manages
  a) user accounts and access control,
  b) job submission and completion,
  c) compute and storage allocation,
  and so on: in essence this implements the high-level policy for
  and orchestrates use of all *other* resources.
- [`scarv/sca3s-analyse`](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s-analyse)
  houses a wrapper around standard side-channel attacks, which
  can be applied to the data sets generated by the acquisition
  appliance.

## Quickstart

There is no natural quickstart process for SCA3S as a whole; the 
best approach would be to

- start by reading through
  [`scarv/sca3s-spec`](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s-spec),
  i.e., the specification and documentation,
  then
- investigate the other submodules, depending on the use-case
  you have in mind.
