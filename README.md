*Acting as a component part of the
[SCARV](https://www.scarv.org)
project,
`lab.scarv.org` is a collection of resources that support the
development and analysis of cryptographic implementations wrt.
[side-channel attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack):
it places particular emphasis on analogue side-channels (e.g.,
power and EM) stemming from
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org)-based
platforms.*

## Overview

The field of implementation attacks


Although platforms such as
[ChipWhisperer](https://newae.com/tools/chipwhisperer)

research and development challenges in this field are often
exaserbated by a range of practical problems:

capital investment, maintainence and operational experience, logistics\


we view the result as helping to supporting core scientific
tenets such as
[open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)
and
[reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility).

support use-cases such as forms of side-channel aware

- [build-it, break-it, fix-it](https://builditbreakit.org)

## Organisation

Originally this repository housed *all* resources in one place,
but to make them easier to manage, it *now* acts as a container: 
the resources are housed in dedicated submodules.  Specifically, 
these include

- [`scarv/lab-spec`](https://github.com/scarv/lab-spec)
  houses the
  `lab.scarv.org` specification and documentation: we adopt this
  approach because it
  a) offers an overarching perspective of,
     and
  b) deals more neatly with interaction between
  the individual resources (vs. embedding it in said resources).
- [`scarv/lab-target`](https://github.com/scarv/lab-target)
  houses a
  framework for developing target implementations.  The idea is
  that users will fork the repository, which then supports a
  a) uniform communication interface to,
     and
  b) build system for
  the target implementation then developed within it.
- [`scarv/lab-acquire`](https://github.com/scarv/lab-acquire)
  houses the
  software portion of the acquisition appliance; in combination
  with appropriate hardware, it allows generation data sets
  (e.g., power consumption traces)
  stemming from execution of a given target implementation.
- [`scarv/lab-cloud`](https://github.com/scarv/lab-cloud)
  houses the
  cloud, or, more specifically
  [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services)-based,
  infrastructure which manages
  a) user accounts and access control,
  b) job submission and completion,
  c) compute and storage allocation,
  and so on: in essence this implements the high-level policy for
  and orchestrates use of all *other* resources.
- [`scarv/lab-analyse`](https://github.com/scarv/lab-analyse)
  houses a wrapper around standard side-channel attacks, which
  can be applied to the data sets generated by the acquisition
  appliance.
